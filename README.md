# Abstract
The development of Lifelong Language Models (LLMs) represents a shift from static to dynamic learning systems. LLMs are designed to continuously learn and adapt throughout their lifecycle. This project is committed to develop an LLM capable of continuously assimilating and integrating new data, thereby staying abreast of the ever-evolving linguistic landscape. Key to this endeavor is an innovative approach to data integration that ensures continuous learning without the need for retraining from the ground up. Special attention is paid to mechanisms designed to prevent catastrophic forgetting, enabling the model to retain previously acquired knowledge while seamlessly incorporating new information.

Central to our methodology is the validation of data sources, ensuring the relevance and reliability of the information being integrated into the model. This process is crucial for maintaining the model's accuracy and mitigating biases. Additionally, we address the computational challenges inherent in such a dynamic system, proposing efficient strategies to manage resource requirements effectively. The model's adaptability to the nuanced evolution of language, including semantics and contextual shifts, is a cornerstone of our research. We employ sophisticated algorithms capable of understanding and adapting to these subtleties over time. To evaluate the model's performance, we have developed a comprehensive set of metrics that go beyond traditional benchmarks, focusing on long-term effectiveness and adaptability in real-world scenarios.

This revised approach aims to provide a more thorough understanding of our project's scope and aspirations, addressing the critical aspects of lifelong learning in NLP.

## Features
### Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)
#### A sophisticated technique to prevent the loss of previously learned information (catastrophic forgetting) by intelligently moderating the learning process. EWC identifies crucial neural network weights and applies constraints to preserve them, enabling the model to learn new tasks without overriding critical past knowledge.

## θ* = argmin θ L_B(θ) + ½ λ ∑_i θ*_A,i (θ_i - θ*_A,i)^2
- `θ*` represents the optimal set of parameters after training on the new task B.
- `argmin θ` denotes the argument of the parameters θ that minimizes the following expression.
- `L_B(θ)` is the loss function for the new task B.
- The second term represents the EWC penalty, which constrains the parameters based on their importance to task A.
- `λ` is a hyperparameter that balances the importance of new learning (task B) against retaining previous knowledge (task A).
- `θ*_A,i` is the value of the i-th parameter after training on the previous task A.
- `θ_i` is the current value of the i-th parameter while training on task B.
- The summation ∑_i runs over all parameters.

### Progressive Neural Networks
### A groundbreaking approach that allows our model to accumulate and transfer knowledge across multiple tasks. By creating separate neural network pathways for different tasks and connecting them, the model can leverage previously learned features, reducing the time and data required for new task learning.
  
## h^{(k)}_i = f \left( W^{(k)}_i h^{(k)}_{i-1} + \sum_{j<k} U^{(k:j)}_i h^{(j)}_{i-1} \right)

- `h^{(k)}_i` is the activation of the i-th layer in the k-th task-specific network.
- `f` represents the non-linear activation function.
- `W^{(k)}_i` is the weight matrix for the i-th layer in the k-th network.
- `h^{(k)}_{i-1}` is the activation of the previous (i-1)-th layer in the k-th network.
- The summation term ∑_{j<k} U^{(k:j)}_i h^{(j)}_{i-1} represents the lateral connections.
    - `U^{(k:j)}_i` is the lateral connection weight matrix from the i-th layer of the j-th network to the i-th layer of the k-th network.
    - `h^{(j)}_{i-1}` is the activation from the previous (i-1)-th layer of the j-th network.
- The sum of the weighted activations from both the current and previous task networks are passed through the non-linear function to generate the current layer's activation.

This structure allows the network to retain and utilize knowledge acquired from previous tasks, aiding in the learning of new tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

### Dynamic Neural Network Architectures
Dynamic neural networks are designed to adapt their behavior dynamically based on the input. The output `y` of such a network can be expressed as a combination of various functions, each modulated by a gating mechanism. The formula is as follows:

## y = \sum_{n=1}^{N} [G(x)]n F_n(x) = \sum{n=1}^{N} \alpha_n F_n(x)

- `y` is the output of the dynamic neural network.
- `N` is the total number of functions or modules in the network.
- `G(x)` represents the gating mechanism, which is a function of the input `x`.
- `[G(x)]_n` denotes the output of the gating mechanism for the n-th module, often interpreted as the weight or importance assigned to that module for the given input.
- `F_n(x)` is the n-th function or module in the network, also a function of the input `x`.
- `\alpha_n` is an alternative notation for `[G(x)]_n`, emphasizing its role as a weight or coefficient for the n-th module.

In this setup, each module `F_n(x)` contributes to the final output `y`, with its contribution being modulated by the corresponding gating output `[G(x)]_n` or `\alpha_n`. This allows the network to dynamically adjust its behavior based on the input, potentially enhancing its ability to handle a wide range of scenarios or tasks.


### Replay Mechanisms
For a neural network model M, trained over tasks T1, T2, ..., Tn:

1. Train M on T1 with data D1, storing a subset S1 of D1.
2. When training on subsequent task Ti (i > 1):
   - Combine a new dataset Di with a sampled subset from S1, S2, ..., Si-1.
   - Update the model M using the combined dataset. The formula is as follows:

## M(Ti) = Train(M(Ti-1), Di ∪ Sample(S1 ∪ S2 ∪ ... ∪ Si-1))

Where:
- M(Ti) is the model trained up to task Ti.
- Di is the dataset for task Ti.
- Sj is the stored subset from task Tj.
- Sample(·) is a function to sample data from the stored subsets.
- Train(·, ·) represents the training process.

# Experience Replay Mechanism

Experience Replay is a pivotal technique in reinforcement learning, particularly when training neural networks like deep Q-networks. It involves storing the agent's experiences and reusing this stored data for training. The mechanism is succinctly described in the research as follows:

To perform experience replay, we store the agent's experiences et = (st, at, rt, st+1) at each time-step t in a data set Dt = {e1, …, et}. During learning, we apply Q-learning updates on samples (or mini-batches) of experience (s, a, r, s') ∼ U(D), drawn uniformly at random from the pool of stored samples.


Here, `et` denotes an experience at time `t`, comprising the state `st`, action `at`, reward `rt`, and the next state `st+1`. The dataset `Dt` aggregates these experiences over time.

The update mechanism for the Q-learning algorithm, using a loss function `Li(θi)`, is defined as:

## Li(θi) = E(s, a, r, s') ∼ U(D)[(r + γ maxa' Q(s', a'; θ−i) − Q(s, a; θi))^2]


- **What is Experience Replay?**
  Experience Replay is like a memory bank for a learning agent (like a robot or a software agent in a game). In this "memory bank," the agent stores its past experiences, which include what it saw (state), what it did (action), what reward it got (reward), and what the next situation was (next state).

- **How is it Used?**
  While training, instead of learning only from the most recent experience, the agent randomly samples and learns from a mix of its past experiences stored in this memory bank. This process is similar to a student revising from a mix of old and new notes while preparing for an exam.

- **Benefits of Experience Replay**
  1. **More Efficient Learning**: By revisiting old experiences, the agent can learn more efficiently, finding patterns and insights it might have missed the first time.
  2. **Breaking Correlation**: It helps break the correlation between consecutive learning steps, providing a more diverse and balanced learning experience.
  3. **Stability**: This method adds stability to the learning process, as the agent isn't overly influenced by recent experiences but learns from a broader range of past experiences.


### Meta-Learning Algorithms
For a learning model M, across a range of tasks T1, T2, ..., Tn:

1. Define a meta-learner Λ that adjusts the learning strategy of M.
2. For each task Ti:
   - Train M on Ti using the current strategy defined by Λ.
   - Update Λ based on the performance of M on Ti. The formula is as follows:


## Λ(Ti) = Update(Λ(Ti-1), Performance(M, Ti))
## M(Ti) = Train(M, Di, Strategy(Λ(Ti)))

Where:
- M(Ti) is the model after training on task Ti.
- Di is the dataset for task Ti.
- Λ(Ti) is the meta-learner after adapting to task Ti.
- Update(·, ·) represents the update process of the meta-learner.
- Performance(·, ·) evaluates M's performance on task Ti.
- Strategy(Λ(Ti)) defines the learning strategy based on the current state of Λ.
